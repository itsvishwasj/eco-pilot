# eco_pilot

The Eco-Pilot Mobile App is a solution developed for CODESPRINT 2025.

The project addresses Problem Statement: “Build a mobile application that calculates and visualizes a user’s daily carbon emissions from travel, food, and energy usage, offering tips for reduction.”

The app is built on a modern, fast stack: 
  Front-End (Mobile): Flutter, Dart.
  Back-End/Data: Firebase Firestore.
  APIs & Libraries: Firebase Core API, firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore.

Future scalability includes:
  AI Integration: Use LLMs (e.g., Gemini) to suggest low-carbon food swaps.
  Corporate Gamification: Expand to enterprise/university dashboards.
  API Integration: Connect directly to Smart Home Energy APIs.
